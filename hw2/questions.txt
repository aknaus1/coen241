5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions? (4 pts)
	To pass different arguments to the curl, just replace value following -d flag.  Alternatively if using faas-cli just replace the echo value being piped in.


6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs? (4 pts)
	To change the function to react to different inputs, I would check the input against a list of urls and output different data if a match is found.
